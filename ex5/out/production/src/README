=====================================================

the package filesprocessing has all the exercise files in it.
the Filter file has Filter abstract class in it with one abstract method and another public for help.
all the files under it are Filters for the files, each one has its functionality.
FileFactory, here I made a method to make a Filter by what written under the FILTER word line.
Order, this abstract class has one method to implement in his ancestors: AbsOrder, TypeOrder, SizeOrder.
I used compareTo() function in TypeOrder andAbsOrder, but in SizeOrder I used "==","<",">", to compare between
the lengths.
OrderFactory, this class creates an order by the line under "ORDER" word.
I made a parent class for Exceptions called HelperException, and there are 3 types of Exceptions, one for bad format,
one of bad parameters and one for section errors, like missing "FILTER" word in the start of each section.
Section, has an array of warnings to print at the end of the program, also an array of the filtered and ordered files.
Parsing, this class is responsible for parsing the command file and starts to work with it.
DirectoryProcessor, this class takes the argument from the system and starts to parse and works with the files.
