=====================================================

the package filesprocessing has all the exercise files in it.

the Filter file has Filter abstract class in it with one abstract method and another public for help.
all the files under it are Filters for the files, each one has its functionality.

FileFactory, here I made a method to make a Filter by what written under the FILTER word line.

Order, this abstract class has one method to implement in his ancestors: AbsOrder, TypeOrder, SizeOrder.
    I used compareTo() function in TypeOrder and AbsOrder, but in SizeOrder I used "==","<",">", to compare
    between the sizes.

OrderFactory, this class creates an order by the line under "ORDER" word.

I made a parent class for Exceptions called HelperException, and there are 2 types of Exceptions, one for bad
parameters and one for section errors, like missing "FILTER" word in the start of each section.
I heard some rumors that says that we cannot inherits from the Exception class directly, this means that if I
want to create a new Exception and use it some where, I should made another father class for this exception
that inherits from the Exception class, so I made the HelperException to inherits from the Exception class,
then I made the two Exceptions that I want in my coding, that both of them inherits from the HelperException.
Then finally I handled them in the main method in DirectoryProcessor.

Section, has an array of warnings to print at the end of the program, also an array of the filtered and
ordered files.

Parsing, this class is responsible for parsing the command file and starts to work with it.

DirectoryProcessor, this class takes the argument from the system and starts to parse and works with the files.

in sorting by TypeOrder and SizeOrder, if any two files has the same Type or Size, I compared the absolute
path for both of them, then sorted them.
