file description:
Book.java
Patron.java
Library.java
the Book file have the Book class in it which describes all the fields of each book we initial, it contains 7
fields and 5 methods and one constructor.
the Patron file have the Patron class in it which describes all the fields of each patron who wants to borrow
a book, the class contains 6 fields and 3 methods and one constructor.
the Library file have the Library class in it which describes all the fields of each library we have, the
class contains 7 fields and 10 methods and one constructor.

design:
the Book class was easy to implement, because everything is clear, the book have several fields that describe
it, some are immutable and some are mutable, like the name is immutable and the comic value is mutable, the
methods are: 1- stringRepresentation = it returns some of the book's fields as a string.

             2- getLiteraryValue = it calculates and returns the literary value of a certain book.

             3- setBorrowerId = it sets the borrower id of this book to the given id.

             4- getCurrentBorrowerId = it returns the current borrower id of a certain book.

             5- returnBook = it sets the borrower id of a certain book to -1.

the Patron class also was easy to implement because of the explicit description of it in the api file, like
the Book class, it has several fields, some are immutable like the first name and others are mutable like the
comic value chosen by a certain patron.
the methods are: 1- stringRepresentation = it returns the first name and the last name of the patron separated
                    by space, and of course as a string.

                 2- getBookScore = it calculates by a certain equation the score of the given book.

                 3- willEnjoyBook = it returns true if the patron will enjoy the book or false if he will not.

the Library class not like Book class or Patron class, it is more complex than the others, it has several
fields, some are immutable like the maximum capacity of books in the library and the other are mutable like
the number of the current books in the library.
the methods are: 1- addBookToLibrary = it adds the given book to the library if it is has a place and returns
                    the place of it and the same if it is in the library before, and -1 otherwise.

                 2- isBookValid = checks if the book id is valid or not.

                 3- getBookId = returns the place of the given book in the library and -1 otherwise.

                 4- isBookAvailable = checks if the given book has no borrower or not.

                 5- registerPatronToLibrary = it register the given patron to the library if there is a place
                    in it or if he is in the library before and returns his place, and -1 otherwise.

                 6- isPatronIdValid = checks if the given patron id valid in the library or not.

                 7- getPatronId = return the place of the given patron in the library and -1 otherwise.

                 8- borrowBook = it marks the book with the given patron id if the book is available and if he
                    will enjoy it, returns true if the process succeeded or false if not.

                 9- returnBook = marks the given book as returned (by returnBook method in Book class).

                 10- suggestBookToPatron = tries to find a book that the given patron will enjoy the most and
                     returns it, and null if there is not.

borrowBook method was difficult also the suggestBookToPatron method.
