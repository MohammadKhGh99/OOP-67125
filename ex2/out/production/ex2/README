*the Aggressive file has the Aggressive type of SpaceShip and what it could do while playing.
*the Basher file has the Basher type of SpaceShip and what it could do while playing.
*the Drunkard file has the Drunkard type of SpaceShip and what it could do while playing.
*the Human file has the Human type of SpaceShip and what it could do while playing.
*the Runner file has the Runner type of SpaceShip and what it could do while playing.
*the Special file has the Special type of SpaceShip and what it could do while playing.
*the SpaceShip file is the father of all the files above, they all extend from it, and have fields in common.
*the SpaceShipFactory file is the factory that produce SpaceShip by the program parameters, it takes them like
chars and gives us an array of all the types of the entered types of SpaceShips.

I make the ability to add more methods to each class is accessible, anyone has the files can add whatever he
wants, I think that I didn't make any method related to any method in another class, that means that if we
replaced the 6 files of types of SpaceShips the program will start without errors and smoothly, for
understandability I added comments above every field and method and even class, what this method do, what this
 class describes, for what this field used...
 I think that the 6 files of SpaceShip has no relationship other than their only father (SpaceShip class),
 they have some processes in common, the basher and aggressive and special pursue the other spaceships, the
 fire, shield on\off, teleporting, the special spaceship has a lot of different things that differ from the
 other ships, like the initial health, initial max energy...
 the drunkard spaceship: I made it to do everything randomly, once accelerate to the left and once to the
 right and once forward, it puts the shield on once per.. i don't know :)
 the special spaceship: his movement like aggressive and basher, it will pursue the other spaceships, and will
  fire at the enemy a lot of shots when it become close to it, it will put the shield all the time! the
  initial max energy and current energy are 1000, the initial health is 30 and increasing, its like god mode,
  no one can defeat it!!!
